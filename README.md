# win10-update-disabler
This is a simple tool to disable the nasty auto-updates included in Windows 10.
It's not a hack, it just simply disables 2 services which are responsible for the updates: "Update Orchestrator Service" and "Windows Update".
Since all it does is disable this, it has no real bad consequence, you can at any given point re-enable it from inside the tool or manually.
